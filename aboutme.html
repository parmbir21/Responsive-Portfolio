        <p>Hello! I am Parmbir Singh. I don't typically like information about me online, so please excuse the fact that you cannot see my amazing face and in return I give a hand draw (in Microsoft Paint) portrait that I did myself that has been compared to The Greats such as Van Gogh and Da Vinci. Some say that my real face goes beyond the comprehension of mere mortals and can only be described as "a mix bewteen a moldy old cardboard box that is being stretched out due to you shoving your oversized college textbook into so you can return it, and a comicbook civilan that had a horrible accident with nuclear material, but rather than becoming a superhero, I am still just a civilan that now also has a hairing grooming problem due to excessive amounts of hair growth."</p>

        <br>

        <p>With formalities out of the way, allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. I am someonme that enjoys that enjoys the very simple and functional lifestyle. I don't have a lot going on in my life, nor do I do much in my free time. Where most people enjoy the outdoors and actively participate in sports (whether that be playing them or following teams), I don't enjoy those activities. I am more of a listless and laid back sort of person. That isn't to say that I don't have any interest in going on hikes or playing basketball on the occasion, but I wouldn't describe those qualities as fitting me. What I enjoy doing in my free time is play games (videogames or tabletop) with some friends. That doesn't always mean that I am playing with them, but sometimes it is nice to just sit in a call with them while we all do our own things and just talk about what is going on in our lives.</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>I also enjoy watching anime. As you can see from the last social media link (located in the drop down social media nav bar tab), I do like to keep track of what I am currently watching, what I have watched, and what I plan to watch -- although that list only ever seems to expand rather than shrink. I do also have a more personal spreadsheet that includes a lot more data that I find interesting. And this is not limited to just anime -- I also find just working with data super interesting as you can draw many interesting conculsions and use those conculsions to make meaningful changes or just learn something new about the information/topic. I have a multitude of spreadsheets just to gather [seemingly] random items in my life that I like to track and just to gain information on. These spreadsheets vary from tracking anime, to expense tracking and categorizing, to time tracking! I just find it endlessly interesting to ask myself a question and be able to find interesting results and use that to make better judgements about those topics.</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>And that's about all I can say about myself. I don't really talk much about myself and thus don't really have a lot to say so sorry for keeping it short and simple. I guess if you want to know more about me, you can always shoot me a message or email or something. I will most likely ignore it, but it's worth a try! (I do actually read the messages that people do send me, so don't be shy!)</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>Update! I asked my friends what words they would use to describe me and why. Some described me as robotic due to me being unreasonably objective a lot of the time. Others described my lifestyle as minimalistic due to me not having a lot of possesions. I would diagree with this idea of me being a minimalist. While I do have a relatively minimalist lifestyle, that is more of a byproduct of the resulting lifestyle choices I make which I would describe as: "functionalist." As the name suggests, I make choices for my lifestyle that serve a function in my life. It just so happens that I  don't need many things in my life for it to function at a reasonable level.</p>
